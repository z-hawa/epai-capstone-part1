### This is Zubair Hawa's implementation of the typeform clone
<br> Expect bugs as this hasn't tested rigorously due to time constraints and many illnesses experienced

Let's start

## Login
The form login is really easy to understand and the form's multiple parts can only be accessed with login
Login is needed basically, and the only things that can be accessed without login are the forms
The dashboard is the first thing you're redirected to and the password for login is tsai99 with the login ID being tsai

## Forms
All of the forms have their own classes and these are passed on to the forms. Due to me not knowing anything about HTML I haven't been able to figure out the likert forms.
I haven't been able to test out these either due to the aforementioned reasons.

## Editing the form
The only options available in editing are removing and adding questions while also changing the time of the quiz.

## Sharing 
Sharing the form is accessible through the dashboard. Just copy the link and share it anyone
